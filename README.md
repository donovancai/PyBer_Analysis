## Pyber Analysis


### Overview of the Analysis

The new analysis is aimed at visualizing the ride-sharing data for total fares between different city types for the first four months of the year. To accomplish this task, the ride-sharing are grouped by total fares and total rides to showcase the total for city type, it is then furthered categorized into weekly intervals. This visualization tells the story of differences in total fares between city types, as well as whether similar trends exist for different city types on a weekly basis. 


### Results

#### Overall Summary

By looking at the overall summary (table)[LINK], it can be seen that urban areas generate the most number of rides and therefore highest total fares. However, on a average fare per ride basis, rural areas generate $10 more per ride than urban areas. This is the same outcome for average fare per driver, as drivers in rural areas collect on average $55.49 per ride, whereas urban drivers only generate on average $16.57 per ride, a difference of about $40. 

These differences can be explained by the vast amount of drivers in urban areas vs. rural. Although total fares for urban areas are about 9x that of rural areas, there are also about 30x more urban drivers than rural. This quickly brings down the average fare per ride and driver.


#### Weekly Performance

Looking at the weekly trend for each city type ((HERE)[LINK]), it can be concluded that total fares for rural and suburban areas are more consistent than urban areas. A notable mention that can be exhibited by three trend lines is that all city types experienced a spike in fares for third week of February, which includes President’s Day in the US (February 18, 2019). An explanation for the volatility in urban areas’ trend line could be that there are more things to do/happening in urban areas in the month of March as compared to suburban and rural. 


### Summary

One recommendation to increase fares in urban areas for the low points in March could be to look at whether the peaks in March were due to holiday/events happening around the cities. For the two weeks that exhibited lower total fares, discounts on fares can incentivize people to use Pyber. 

Another recommendation to increase revenue in rural areas could be to increase driver recruitment efforts. As mentioned earlier, the average fare per driver in rural areas is $55.49, which looks great on recruitment ads. Rural areas has a total of 125 trips for a total of 78 drivers. By bringing in more drivers, it will shorten the time waiting for riders and could motivate more people to use Pyber. 

Lastly, recruitment ads should also be used for suburban areas. There are a total of 625 trips for a total of 490 drivers in suburban areas. By bringing in more drivers, time waiting for riders will decrease and more people will be drawn to Pyber for increased service level.
